# ACL 2020 papers by authors who are members of underrepresented groups (URMs)
This is a script that filters the list of [ACL 2020 papers}(https://acl2020.org/) down to only those for which at least one author belongs to an underrepresented group, according to the "members" section of the [BIG Directory](http://www.winlp.org/big-directory/).

## Incomplete data
The filter only outputs papers for which at least one author is found in the BIG Directory. If a paper should be found in this collection, but isn't, feel free to extend the BIG Directory to make this script more reliable!

## Room for improvement
As [noted](https://github.com/ojahnn/acl2020-urm-papers/issues/1) by Sebastian Ruder, the BIG Directory contains allies as well as members of URMs. Filtering out allies could possibly be done based on the free text column of the original BIG data. If in doubt, consider looking up the authors in BIG directly to find out whether a reason for inclusion in the directory is explicitly given. Note that the absence of an explicit reason does not mean that there isn't a reason.
