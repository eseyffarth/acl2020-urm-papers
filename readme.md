# ACL 2020 papers by authors who are members of underrepresented groups (URMs)
This is a script that filters the list of [ACL 2020 papers}(https://acl2020.org/) down to only those for which at least one author belongs to an underrepresented group, according to the "members" section of the [BIG Directory](http://www.winlp.org/big-directory/).

## Incomplete data
The filter only outputs papers for which at least one author is found in the BIG Directory. If a paper should be found in this collection, but isn't, feel free to extend the BIG Directory to make this script more reliable!
